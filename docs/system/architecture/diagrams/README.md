# Architecture Diagrams Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture diagrams used within the project, detailing the various types of diagrams, the tools used to create them, and the standards we adhere to.

## Types of Diagrams

1. **Infrastructure Topology**  
   This diagram illustrates the physical and logical layout of the infrastructure, including servers, databases, and network components.

2. **Application Architecture**  
   This diagram outlines the structure of the application, including its components, modules, and the relationships between them.

3. **Data Flow Diagrams**  
   These diagrams represent the flow of data within the system, showing how data is processed and transferred between different components.

4. **CQRS Patterns**  
   Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns help to separate the read and write operations of the application, optimizing performance and scalability.

5. **Container Diagrams**  
   Container diagrams visualize the individual containers (applications, services, databases) within the architecture and their interactions.

## Tools Used

- **Lucidchart**  
  A web-based diagramming application used for creating various architecture diagrams.

- **Draw.io**  
  A free tool for creating diagrams that can be integrated with various platforms.

- **Microsoft Visio**  
  A diagramming tool used for creating detailed and professional diagrams.

## Standards

We follow industry best practices for creating architecture diagrams, ensuring that:
- Diagrams are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- Standard symbols and notations are used for consistency.
- Diagrams are regularly updated to reflect the current architecture.

This document is a living document and will be updated as our architecture evolves.
