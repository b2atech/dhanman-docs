## 🎯 Key Architectural Characteristics

### Microservices Architecture
- **6 core services** aligned with bounded contexts
- **Independent deployment** and scaling per service
- **Database per service** for data isolation
- **Event-driven integration** via RabbitMQ

### CQRS & Event Sourcing
- **Separate read and write models** for optimal performance
- **Domain events** published to event bus
- **Event handlers** in consuming services
- **Eventual consistency** across bounded contexts

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Rich domain models** with business logic
- **Aggregates** as consistency boundaries
- **Value objects** for immutable concepts
- **Domain services** for cross-aggregate operations

### Resilience Patterns
- **Retry policies** with exponential backoff
- **Circuit breakers** for failing services
- **Bulkheads** for resource isolation
- **Timeout policies** for bounded waiting
- **Health checks** for service monitoring

### Security
- **Auth0** for authentication with JWT tokens
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with permissions
- **Multi-tenancy** with data isolation
- **Encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Audit logging** for compliance

## 🔄 Data Flow Example: Invoice Creation

```
1. User submits invoice (Frontend)
   ↓
2. Sales API validates and creates invoice
   ↓
3. Invoice saved to PostgreSQL (Sales DB)
   ↓
4. InvoiceCreatedEvent published to RabbitMQ
   ↓
   ├─▶ 5a. Common Service: Updates ledger entries
   ├─▶ 5b. Notification Service: Sends email to customer
   └─▶ 5c. Analytics Service: Updates dashboard metrics
   ↓
6. Hangfire schedules payment reminder (delayed job)
```

## 📐 Design Principles

1. **Business Domain First**: Architecture driven by business capabilities
2. **Evolutionary Design**: Support incremental changes and technological evolution
3. **Cloud-Native**: Designed for containerized deployment and horizontal scalability
4. **Developer Experience**: Balance architectural rigor with developer productivity
5. **Operational Excellence**: Build observability and reliability into the architecture
6. **Security by Design**: Security considerations at every layer
7. **Fail Fast, Recover Quickly**: Resilience patterns for fault tolerance
