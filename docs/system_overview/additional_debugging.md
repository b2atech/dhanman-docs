### üßë‚Äçüíª Check resource usage for troubleshooting crashes
> Shows CPU and memory usage for all processes.
```bash
top    # Real-time system monitor; press q to exit

```bash
htop   # Advanced system monitor (install with sudo apt install htop)
```
> Shows RAM usage for a specific service:
```bash
ps aux | grep dhanman-common-qa
```

> Check if you can connect to RabbitMQ on port 5673:
```bash
nc -vz localhost 5673    # Test connection to localhost port 5673
```
> For remote hosts, replace `localhost` with the IP.

---

### üß© Check core dumps (advanced crash debugging)
> Install core dump tools:
```bash
sudo apt install systemd-coredump    # Install core dump viewer
```
> List all core dumps:
```bash
coredumpctl list                     # List all core dumps
```
> Show info about the latest core dump:
```bash
coredumpctl info                     # Details of the last core dump
```

---

### üï∞Ô∏è Check server uptime and reboot history
> See how long the server has been running:
```bash
uptime    # Shows current uptime
```
> Check last reboot time:
```bash
who -b    # Shows last boot time
```
> List all reboot events:
```bash
last reboot    # Shows reboot history
```

---

### üìÖ Show last successful run, start, stop, and crash times for a service
